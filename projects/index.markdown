## Classification of carbonaceous meteorites using machine learning

Carbonaceous chondritic meteorites are a class of stony meteorites rich in organic content, including
a variety of amino acids and other hydrocarbons. Studying these meteorites provides important insight into
early Solar System organic chemistry and their potential part in the emergence and evolvement of life on Earth.
The current classification system for carbonaceous chondrites is mineralogical, with classes depending
on isotopic composition and the degree of alteration, serving as a means for meteoriticists to trace a
chondrite's history and previous environmental conditions.

Through the Young Scientist Program at the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, I analyzed, classified,
and modeled the organic contents of carbonaceous chondritic meteorites using Fourier transform ion
cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) analysis.
