## Hello!

Jin Yeh (preferably pronounced “Jean”) is a Master’s student in the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences and the Astrobiology Program at the University of Washington. She is combining ecology and astrobiology in the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory, studying dynamic landscape change with a focus
on wildflower ecosystems in extreme climate conditions. Her interests include spatiotemporal
analysis of wildflower bloom dynamics, forecasting extreme climate impacts, and the translation of plant response on Earth into extraterrestrial
environments for biosignature detection.

Jin has a primary background in geophysics and planetary science, earning her Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Washington
with a major in Earth and Space Sciences and a minor in Physics. Overall, her interdisciplinary background encourages her to explore dynamic
changes both on Earth and beyond.
